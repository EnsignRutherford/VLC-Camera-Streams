# VLC-Camera-Streams

For Microsoft Windows, but could be reworked for Linux as well.

Instructions:

1) Place bg_1280x720.jpg, camstrms.bat, and camstrms.vlm in the C:\Windows directory (requires admin access).
2) Replace the mosaic_chX input with the URL to the RTSP feed of your camera adding the user and password who has access to the feed.
3) Replace the cameraX input  with the URL to the RTSP feed of your camera adding the user and password who has access to the feed mimicking the same camera that is in the mosaic input.
4) Run camstrms.bat
5) Profit!
