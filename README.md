# VLC-Camera-Streams

For Microsoft Windows, but could be reworked for Linux as well.

Instructions:

1) Place bg_1280x720.jpg, camstrms.bat, and camstrms.vlm in the C:\Windows directory (requires admin access).
2) Replace the mosaic_chX input with the URL to the RTSP feed of your camera adding the user and password who has access to the feed.
3) Run camstrms.bat
4) Profit!
